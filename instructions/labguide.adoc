# Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh in Action

## Preface

It might be quiet uncommon to build the guide for your lab, but in that special case it does make sense! 
The lab uses dynamic urls depending on your provisioned environment and for your comfort you can 
just copy the commands from your labguide and paste them in your cmd or shell with the correct urls. 

If you have any questions feel free to reach out for me - Sebastian Dehn

## Getting the lab guide

### Make sure you got the OpenShift 4 CLI tool
Please download the OpenShift 4 commandline client for your operating system here: 
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/[OpenShift 4 client]

#### Linux & Mac

Extract the downloaded tar file with:
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
tar -xzf {{ Your download location }}
----

Move the extracted file to /usr/bin/
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
sudo mv {{ path to downloaded and extracted oc client }} /usr/bin/oc4
----

If you already downloaded an OpenShift 3 client, create an alias for your terminal session: 
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
alias oc=oc4
----

#### Windows

Unzip the archive and open your 'cmd.exe'. 

Navigate to your download location in cmd.exe and type the following:
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
doskey oc=oc.exe
----

You can verify it is working by simply typing:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc version
----

### Deploying the guide

#### Prerequsites 

Please be aware that there are two sections for deployment. One for Linux & Mac and a second one for Windows
Set the following variables in your shell or cmd to deploy the labguide: 

* API_URL=Use the API url from your link:https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_emeaforum[Labinformation Page^] 
* MASTER_URL=Use the Console url from your link:https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_emeaforum[Labinformation Page^] 
* LABUSER=opentlc-mgr
* LABUSER_PASSWORD=r3dh4t1!
* BASTION_FQDN=foo.bar.com
* GUID=Use your GUID from your link:https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_emeaforum[Labinformation Page]
* ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN=Just use the part 'apps.cluster-*.opentlc.com' from your link:https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_emeaforum[Labinformation Page^]

The variables could look like the folling:

* API_URL=https://api.cluster-a76ba.a76ba.sandbox1472.opentlc.com:6443
* MASTER_URL=http://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-a76ba.a76ba.sandbox1472.opentlc.com
* LABUSER=opentlc-mgr
* LABUSER_PASSWORD=r3dh4t1!
* BASTION_FQDN=foo.bar.com
* GUID=a76ba
* ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN=apps.cluster-a76ba.a76ba.sandbox1472.opentlc.com

For Windows cmd your command could look like:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
set API_URL=https://api.cluster-a76ba.a76ba.sandbox1472.opentlc.com:6443
----

For your shell the command could look like: 

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
export API_URL=https://api.cluster-a76ba.a76ba.sandbox1472.opentlc.com:6443
----

#### Deploy with shell

Just copy and paste the following commands to your shell.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc login -u opentlc-mgr -p r3dh4t1! $MASTER_URL
----

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc new-project labguide
----

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc new-app -n labguide --name istio \
quay.io/osevg/workshopper -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sifa91/istio-lab-forum-2020/master/instructions/" \
-e WORKSHOPS_URLS="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sifa91/istio-lab-forum-2020/master/instructions/_forum20.yml" \
-e API_URL=$API_URL \
-e MASTER_URL=$MASTER_URL \
-e LABUSER=$LABUSER \
-e LABUSER_PASSWORD=$LABUSER_PASSWORD \
-e BASTION_FQDN=$BASTION_FQDN \
-e GUID=$GUID \
-e ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN=$ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
--> Found container image 82cc938 (11 months old) from quay.io for "quay.io/osevg/workshopper"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "istio:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "istio"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "istio"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "istio"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "istio" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "istio" created
    service "istio" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/istio' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

At last expose your guide and get your guide url

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc expose service istio
----

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get route -n labguide istio -o 'jsonpath={.spec.host}'
----


#### Deploy with cmd

Just copy and paste the following commands to your cmd.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc login -u opentlc-mgr -p r3dh4t1! %MASTER_URL%
----

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc new-project labguide
----

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc new-app -n labguide --name istio ^

-e LABUSER_PASSWORD=%LABUSER_PASSWORD% ^
-e BASTION_FQDN=%BASTION_FQDN% ^
-e GUID=%GUID% ^
-e ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN=%ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN%

Wait approximately one minute until the pod has started.
Now copy the url to your browser and have fun with the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh in Action lab! :-)
