# TEB93D - Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh in Action

## Purpose

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of
and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the burden
of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed on the
application developer, with different or non-existent support for microservice
concepts depending on language and framework.

The service mesh concept pushes this responsibility to the infrastructure, with
features for traffic management, distributed tracing and observability, policy
enforcement, and service/identity security, freeing the developer to focus on
business value. In this hands-on session you will learn how to apply some of
these features to a simple polyglot microservices application running on top of
OpenShift using Istio, an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices.

## Background

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio
provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load
balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without
requiring any changes in application code. OpenShift can automatically inject a
special sidecar proxy throughout your environment to enable Istio management for
your application. This proxy intercepts all network communication between your
microservices microservices, and is configured and managed using Istioâ€™s control
plane functionality -- not your application code!

Kiali is an observability console designed to provide operational insight
into the behavior and performance of the service mesh as a whole.

Jaeger is a utility for capturing distributed tracing information of requests
as they travel throughout the mesh.

Prometheus and Grafana are used to capture metrics about the performance and
behavior of the mesh.

These components combined together are the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.

## Conventions
You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. Some of
the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require modification
of the command before execution. If you see a command block with a red border
(see below), the command will require slight modification.

Most command blocks support auto highlighting with a click. If you hover over
the command block above and left-click, it should automatically highlight all the
text to make for easier copying.

## Getting Started

Before you begin please login to Kiali and Jaeger with the following credentials: 

The urls can be discovered as follows:
